This website is a resource for users of the [Old Bailey Online](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/) who are interested in Digital Humanities, Data Science and computational approaches to the OBO's complex data.

I plan to write guides to using the [OBO API](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/about/api), as well as useful tools and methods for processing data obtained via the API.
