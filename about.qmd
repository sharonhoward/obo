## About this website

This website is a resource for users of the [Old Bailey Online](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/) who are interested in Digital Humanities, Data Science and computational approaches to the OBO's complex data.

Initially, it will contain reference guides to using the new (2023) [OBO API](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/about/api). I'd like to include material about useful tools and methods for processing data obtained via the API. And then we'll see.

Code and data will also be available from the [Github repository](https://github.com/sharonhoward/obo)

## About the Old Bailey Online

The *Old Bailey Proceedings Online*, first launched in 2003 with subsequent major updates in 2008 and 2023, makes available a fully searchable, digitised collection of all surviving editions of the Old Bailey Proceedings from 1674 to 1913, and of the Ordinary of Newgateâ€™s Accounts between 1676 and 1772. It allows access to over 197,000 trials and biographical details of approximately 2,500 men and women executed at Tyburn, free of charge for non-commercial use. See the [About the Project pages](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/about/project) for more information about the project methods and evolution.
