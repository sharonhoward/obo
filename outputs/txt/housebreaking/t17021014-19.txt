Thomas Twist , Jane Williams and Mary Buck , of the Parish of Chelsea , were indicted for breaking the House of William Stubbington , in the day time, on the 18th of July last, and taking a Copper, a pair of stuff Curtains, and divers other Goods . It appeared that the Door was broke open whilst the Prosecutor was gone out early to Market, and the Goods gone. There was other Evidence who saw the Women near the House, and saw one of them carry the Copper upon her Head, and the other the Bundles, and the Man was not with them; which the Jury considering, acquitted the Man, and found the two Women Guilty of Felony only .
