Elizabeth Price , of the Parish of St. Dunstans in the West , was indicted for breaking the Dwelling-house of John Lang , in the Day time, no Person being therein, on the 7th of October last, about two in the Afternoon, and taking thence a Serge Counterpain, and other Goods of the said Lang . The first Evidence deposed that he had an occasion to go to a Gentlemans Chamber in the Temple, and did mistake the Stair-Case, and going up four pair of Stairs he saw a hole broke at three pair of Stairs, and looking saw a Woman peep, but did not see her Face, and mistrusting her to be a Thief, he went down Stairs, and spoke to a Gentleman in the lower Room, desiring him to stop her if she should come down whilst he went to call the Porter, and in the mean time the Prisoner came down one pair of Stairs, where she was taken; upon which they went up Stairs, and looking in the hole found some Chissels; but opening the Door found several Trunks and Boxes broke open, and the Goods pack'd up ready to be carried away. The Prisoner denied the Fact, saying, she come to enquire for her Counsellor, and was told he lived in that Stair-Case; she went up Stairs and was taken when she came down: All which Matters the Jury having considered, found her Guilty of Felony only, and acquitted her of breaking the House .
