William King , of the Parish of Wilsdon was Indicted for breaking the House of Henry Forster on the 23d of August last, in the Day time, no Person being therein, and taking thence a Cloath Coat, a Wastcoat, the Goods of Henry Forster, and 2 Coats, a Frock and other Goods of John Payne , and a Damask stuff Gown, the Goods of Elizabeth Gage , Spinster . It appeared that he broke the Wall and got into the House, and took the Goods and carried them into a Wood, where they were found bundled up, and the Prisoner at a distance from them with his Cloaths all Loomy with the Wall. He denied the Fact, saying he knew nothing of it, and was going that way to Harrow on the Hill; but it being but a weak excuse, the Jury found him Guilty .

The Jury found him Guilty . [Death. See summary.]
